The goal was to extend the functionality of the current product by enabling users to watch and discuss movies together in real time — without leaving the platform. <br><br> The solution was built using a pre-defined design system and aimed to integrate seamlessly into the product`s existing structure.' },

The visual system feels clean and approachable, while still emphasizing technical credibility. Thanks to a well-structured layout and thoughtful interactions, users can quickly understand the developer’s value and explore their projects with ease. <br><br> This design not only supports the developer’s personal brand but also provides a strong foundation for professional growth — whether it`s impressing recruiters, attracting freelance clients, or standing out in a competitive tech landscape.', images: [2] }
